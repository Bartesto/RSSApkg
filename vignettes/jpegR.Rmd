`jpegR()` is a function that will create a small jpeg of a location(s) from  
available satellite imagery stored in a local archive. It has been optimized to 
work on USGS Landsat imagery that has been illumination corrected and stored in
a `date/satellite data` folder structure.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
jpegR(wdir, imdir, layer, attrb, start = NA, stop = NA, combo,
  buffer = 2000)
```

##Arguments
* __wdir__ Path to working directory. This directory will include a shape file
which contains the location(s) of interest. 

* __imdir__ Path to local archive of satellite imagery at the path/row level.

* __layer__ Name of the shape file excluding the extension. Most common usage is 
for polygon features of sites of interest but can also be point features.

* __attrb__ Name of the attribute table column heading which contains the unique
identifier for the features. Commonly these is site names.

* __start__ Date to start imagery search. Defaults to none and therefore begins 
with first locally available satellite image for the path/row.

* __stop__ Date to end imagery search. Defaults to none and therefore ends with
last locally available satellite image for the path/row.

* __combo__ Three numbers representing the satellite bands to display in RGB 
colour channels for the output jpegs. For example c(3, 2, 1) would be red green 
and blue.

* __buffer__ How far to buffer the shape file feature to create the extent for 
cropping the satellite image. For example for a projected GDA94 MGA50 satellite 
image, a buffer of 2000 would equate to a 2km buffer around the shape file 
feature. Controls the 'zoom' level of the output jpegs.

##What it does
When called `jpegR()` will:

1. Create a folder named `site_vectors` in the working directory.
1. Split the original shape file into a separate shape file for each unique
identifier in the __attrb__ argument.
1. Create a .txt file containing the name of the original shape file. 
1. Will perform a check of the image directory to ensure all images have correct
dates (checks agaisnt incorrectly dated leap years).
1. Creates a folder named after each new unique shape file and then using that 
location as a centroid, creates a jpeg from all the satellite images conforming 
to the supplied arguments.

##Uses
The main purpose for the output jpegs is for checking image dates at site 
locations for cloud artefacts prior to extracting pixel values for further 
analysis. This is an alternative method for image quality assessment which has 
historically entailed cloud masking entire scenes prior to analysis.

Although originally designed for cloud quality assessment other uses can include:

* Rapid image assessment for impacts (fires, floods, deforestation, etc).

* Narrowing down dates of impacts.

* Creation of inputs for animations.

##Example Output
The below examples show jpegs created showing a polygon feature (in this case a 
wetland) outlined in magenta.

<!-- Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format: -->

<!-- - Never uses retina figures -->
<!-- - Has a smaller default figure size -->
<!-- - Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style -->

<!-- ## Vignette Info -->

<!-- Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette. -->

<!-- ## Styles -->

<!-- The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows: -->

<!--     output:  -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         css: mystyles.css -->

<!-- ## Figures -->

<!-- The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side.  -->

<!-- ```{r, fig.show='hold'} -->
<!-- plot(1:10) -->
<!-- plot(10:1) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML: -->

<!--     output: -->
<!--       rmarkdown::html_vignette: -->
<!--         fig_caption: yes -->

<!-- Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**. -->

<!-- ## More Examples -->

<!-- You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`. -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'} -->
<!-- knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
