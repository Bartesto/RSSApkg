##Introduction
One of the challenges of working in remote sensing and dealing with satellite 
imagery is how to deal with clouds and shadows. There are various automated 
routines that exist to aid the researcher such as:

* Using a cloud filter option when downloading the imagery in the first instance.
* Using an automated cloud masking algorithm such as __fmask__ as used by the 
USGS.

Although these tools are very useful they can be a bit "blunt" as an instrument.

One of the benefits of the explosion of availability of satellite data is that 
dense temporal analysis can now be performed. Phenological cycles can now be 
modelled and monitored and using every suitable image
